# Graph-Neural-Networks

Welcome to our repository for Graph Neural Network (GNN) case studies!

In this repository, we will be exploring a variety of real-world applications of GNNs, including social network analysis, recommendation systems, fraud detection, drug discovery, natural language processing, computer vision, and traffic prediction.

For each case study, we will provide a description and overview of the problem being addressed, a brief overview of the GNN model architecture used to solve it, and a dicussion of the the results and limitations of our analysis. We will also include code and any relevant data sources, so that you can reproduce our results or build upon them for your own projects. However, our primary focus and area of interest is the use of GNNs for the analysis of biomedical images, specifically chest x-ray (CXR) and 2D CT Scan Chest datasets, with the goal of identifying abnormalities in the images using various superpixel image segmentation techniques such as SLIC, QuickShift, etc. We will also highlight the unique challenges and considerations that arise when using GNNs for the analysis of biomedical image data.

We hope that these case studies will serve as a valuable resource for those interested in using GNNs to solve real-world problems and inspire new ideas for future research in this area. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or pull request on GitHub.

Thank you for visiting our repository, and we hope you find our case studies useful!
